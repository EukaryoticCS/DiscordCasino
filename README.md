# DiscordCasino
Hello! I'm Project Greed, a Discord Bot made to model casino games like blackjack, ~~poker~~, and more!

<b>Commands:</b>

<b>----- MISC COMMANDS -----</b>

`/help`: Sends this "help" message with commands and syntaxes 🤓  
`/ping`: Shows the ping of the bot 🏓

<b>----- GAME COMMANDS -----</b>

`/funds`: Shows your available funds 🤑    

`/blackjack`: Starts Blackjack!  

HOW TO PLAY:  
Upon starting Blackjack, both you and the CPU dealer draw 2 cards. Your cards are displayed to you, but the dealer's are not. The initial ante for Blackjack is 30 currency, and it will immediately be taken out of your account upon running the command. During the game, you can take any of these actions at any time by clicking the corresponding button:  

HIT: Draw another card 🃏  
BET 1: Bet 1 currency 💰  
BET 10: Bet 10 currency 💰  
BET 100: Bet 100 currency 💰  
STAND: End the game, comparing your hand to the dealer's hand. The winner is the player whose hand value is closest to 21 without going over. Bets are paid out to the winner based on Blackjack standard payout rules. 🤑  

`/poker`: CANCELLED 😔  

`/slots`: Starts a slots game!    

HOW TO PLAY:    
Upon starting Slots, you will be prompted with a message. This message has 4 buttons:    

BET 1: Bet 1 currency 💰  
BET 10: Bet 10 currency 💰  
BET 100: Bet 100 currency 💰  
SPIN: Spin the slots! The bot will then reply with your spin, displaying emojis to mimic positions on a slot machine. If you get 3 in a row, you win! Bets are then paid out based on the symbol.
